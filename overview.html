This website is designed to provide comprehensive insights into this chronic illness, from its causes and symptoms to the latest research and potential breakthroughs. We aim to explore new scientific approaches, encourage research, and spark discussions that may lead to better management—or even a cure—for Type 1 Diabetes.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">What is Type 1 Diabetes?</h2>
            <div class="p-4 bg-light rounded shadow-sm">
                <p>Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Hence, T1D is a chronic condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone essential for converting food into energy. 
                Unlike Type 2 Diabetes, which is often linked to lifestyle factors, Type 1 Diabetes typically develops in children, adolescents, and young adults, although it can occur at any age. Without insulin, the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels, leading to life-threatening complications if left untreated.
                Scientists are still decoding the exact cause of T1D, but genetic predisposition and environmental triggers are believed to play significant roles. Understanding these triggers is crucial for developing preventive strategies.

            <div class="p-4 bg-light rounded shadow-sm">
                <p>Approximately 830 million individuals globally are affected by diabetes, with the majority residing in low- and middle-income countries. It is concerning to note that more than half of those diagnosed are not receiving adequate treatment. Furthermore, over the past several decades, both the number of individuals diagnosed with diabetes and those who remain untreated have been steadily rising. This trend highlights the critical need for increased awareness and action to address this growing health issue.

                            <strong>🛑 Myth 1:</strong> TYPE 1 DIABETES is caused by eating too much sugar.<br>
                            <strong>✅ FALSE:</strong> Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune disease, not caused by diet or lifestyle. In type 1, the immune system erroneously attacks the beta cells — responsible for producing insulin — in the pancreas, resulting in a lack of insulin.

                            <strong>🛑 Myth 2:</strong> People who have Type 1 Diabetes can't eat sweets or carbs.<br>
                            <strong>✅ Myth:</strong> People with Type 1 Diabetes must avoid certain foods, including sweets, to maintain their health. They can indulge in all kinds of their favourite foods with proper insulin dosage. Ketosis and carbohydrate management, not deprivation.

                            <strong>🛑 Myth 3:</strong> Type 1 Diabetes only affects children.<br>
                            <strong>✅ Fact:</strong> Type 1 Diabetes can actually occur at any age and is sometimes diagnosed in adults. This is called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).

                            <strong>🛑 Myth 4:</strong> Insulin is a cure for Type 1 Diabetes.<br>
                            <strong>✅ Fact:</strong> Insulin is a life-saving treatment, but it is not a cure. "Low carb helps keep blood sugar levels in check, but scientists are still searching for cures, including beta-cell regeneration and immunotherapy.

                            <strong>🛑 Myth 5:</strong> Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes are the same.<br>
                            <strong>✅ Fact:</strong> Although both types are related to how the body handles blood sugar, the former is classified as an autoimmune disease, while the latter is primarily associated with insulin resistance based on genetic and lifestyle factors. The treatment options also vary widely.
