        <section>
            <h3>What is the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes?</h3>
            <p>Diabetes typically divides into two main types: Type 1 and Type 2.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Type 1 diabetes arises when the immune system mistakenly attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This autoimmune condition often emerges during childhood or adolescence, catching many families off guard. Imagine the shock of finding out your child needs lifelong insulin therapy—that's a tough reality to face.</li>
                <li>Type 2 diabetes is often misunderstood; it typically develops later in life and is frequently linked to lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity. While the pancreas continues to produce insulin, the body may become resistant, causing many individuals to remain unaware of their condition until complications arise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Though both types are termed diabetes, they differ significantly. Type 1 diabetes involves an autoimmune response, while Type 2 is largely influenced by lifestyle choices. This distinction prompts important questions about the potential to reverse these conditions, particularly Type 1 diabetes, and ongoing discussions about possible cures merit further exploration.</p>

            <h3>Can Type 1 Diabetes be cured or reversed?</h3>
            <p>While there's no cure for Type 1 Diabetes yet, insightful research is on the way. Scientists are exploring immunotherapy and gene editing (CRISPR) to prevent the autoimmune attack on insulin-producing cells. Though still in development, intensive clinical trials bring hope for the future.</p>
            <p>For now, daily management remains essential—from blood sugar monitoring to insulin therapy and lifestyle adjustments. Beyond the physical challenges, the emotional toll affects both individuals and families. Staying informed about advancements and long-term care is key to improving quality of life while we look toward potential breakthroughs.</p>

            <h3>What are the long-term complications of Type 1 Diabetes?</h3>
            <p>Living with Type 1 Diabetes isn't just about managing blood sugar—it's about staying ahead of potential long-term risks. Over time, uncontrolled glucose levels can lead to complications affecting the nerves, kidneys, and heart.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nerve Damage (Neuropathy):</strong> Nearly 50% of people with diabetes experience some form of nerve damage, often leading to pain, numbness, or tingling in the limbs.</li>
                <li><strong>Kidney Disease (Nephropathy):</strong> Around 30% of those with Type 1 Diabetes may develop kidney issues, which can progress to kidney failure if left unmanaged.</li>
                <li><strong>Heart Disease:</strong> People with diabetes face up to four times the risk of cardiovascular conditions compared to those without diabetes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, routine check-ups, blood sugar control, and a healthy lifestyle can significantly reduce these risks. Taking care of both physical and mental well-being is key—stress and anxiety can impact diabetes management, making a balanced approach essential. Staying proactive in the present can protect your health for years to come.</p>

            <h3>How does Type 1 Diabetes affect mental health?</h3>
            <p>Type 1 Diabetes isn't just a physical condition—it takes a toll on mental health too. The constant need to monitor blood sugar, calculate insulin, and manage daily life can lead to stress, anxiety, and even depression. Many experience cognitive fatigue, struggling with focus and decision-making due to the relentless demands of diabetes management. Recognizing this, healthcare providers are integrating mental health support, therapy, and peer networks into diabetes care. A holistic approach that addresses both physical and emotional well-being is essential to improving quality of life for those living with Type 1 Diabetes.</p>

            <h3>What research is being done to improve Type 1 Diabetes treatment?</h3>
            <p>Scientists and medical professionals are exploring innovative avenues that hold promise for both improving outcomes and transforming lives. Here are a few thrilling areas of focus:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Artificial Pancreas Technology:</strong> Devices that automatically monitor blood sugar levels and adjust insulin delivery in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Islet transplantation:</strong> In the type of islet transplantation used to treat type 1 diabetes, also called islet allo-transplantation, doctors take islets with healthy beta cells from the pancreas of a deceased organ donor. Doctors then inject the healthy islet cells taken from the donor into a vein that carries blood to the liver of a person with type 1 diabetes. A person receiving a transplant is called a recipient. These islets begin to make and release insulin in the recipient's body.</li>
                <li><strong>Stem Cell Therapy:</strong> Groundbreaking studies aiming at regenerating insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, potentially reversing the disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Insulin:</strong> Development of insulin dosage formulations that react to blood glucose levels, releasing precisely when needed and lasting longer.</li>
            </ul>
